CAP 5400 - Digital Image Processing Repository

This is the repository for the Digital Image Processing class I took at USF in Fall 2023.

Throughout the course, we built an image-processing library filled with industry-standard functionality.
Each assignment had us improve this library by adding new functionality to it.
Our final project in the class was a culmination of everything we had learned. It involved collecting images from different sources, including microscopes, infrared cameras, and depth sensors.
We then enchanced these images using the image processing software we had built throughout the semester.
